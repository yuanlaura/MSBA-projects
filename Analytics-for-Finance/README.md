# Cryptocurrency Analysis

> Course Name: Analytics for Finance  
Period: Spring 2021  
Coding Language(s): R, Python  

## Description

This project was completed for an Analytics for Finance course at Santa Clara University as part of the Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) program. In this project, we have analyzed cryptocurrency prices from January 2018 to February 2021 for six different cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, LTC, ADA, XRP, and BNB). We compared the daily cryptocurrency prices with S&P 500 and the value of gold. Using natural language processing (NLP) methods, we also compared the daily cryptocurrency prices with a sentiment analysis performed on tweets gathered from Twitter about the cryptocurrencies.
