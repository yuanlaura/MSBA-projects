# Dashboards with Tableau

> Course Name: Dashboards    
Period: Fall 2021  
Tools: Tableau  

## Description

These dashboards were developed for a Dashboard course at Santa Clara University as part of the Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) program. In this project, we have analyzed crytocurrency prices from January 2018 to February 2021 for six different cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, LTC, ADA, XRP, and BNB). We compared the daily cryptocurrency prices with S&P 500 and the value of gold. Using natural language processing (NLP) methods, we also compared the daily cryptocurrency prices with a sentiment analysis performed on tweets gathered from Twitter about the cryptocurrencies.
