## Description

These dashboards were developed for a Dashboard course at Santa Clara University as part of the Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) program. In the first project, the Dashboard Improvement project, we were given a dashboard of Revenue that needed improvements and our goal was to improve the dashboard to be more visually appealing and informative. In the Kickstarter project, we found a Kaggle dataset on Kickerstarter projects and created a dashboard based on the given dataset.
